```How did the java web applications used to be?```

In the exibit you can see a reconstruction of an 
ancient java web application, that could be dated ~2000-2010 AD.

- it sports a JSP, calculating the fizz buzz of the first 100 numbers
- has a rudimentary rest services made with ```javax.ws.rs```
- it is compiled for java 8, due to limitation of the asm component
- has a working ```web.xml``` file. this file used to be the descriptor of the application,
and basically contain the deployment instructions for the servlet container.
